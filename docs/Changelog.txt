	. initial version
	. command line app skeleton with:

		    . allows to change the loglevel from that configuration file 
		      (no need to edit the logback.xml file inside the .jar file)

		      the default logging to std out.
		. custom uncaught exception handler which logs and mails those unexpected runtime exceptions
		. Mailer component to send emails (plain text or html, with or without attachments)
